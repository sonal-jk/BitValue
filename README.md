# BitValue


BitValue is a React-based web application that allows users to explore information about various cryptocurrencies. The application employs React hooks for state management and integrates with a cryptocurrency RESTful API *CoinCap* to fetch and display relevant data. Users can also search for specific cryptocurrencies within the app.

# Features

* Displays a list of cryptocurrencies.
* Utilizes the axios library to make asynchronous API requests.
* Implements the useEffect and useState hook to fetch cryptocurrency data when the component mounts.
